## 1.8.0

**Release date**: 1018-03-20

This release adds a new pattern, the **Jaeger Jacket** and removed the `acrossBack` measurement in favor of an `acrossBackFactor` option that controls the across back as a fraction of the `shoulderToShoulder` measurement.

### Added

 - The Jaeger Jacket is now available in Beta

### Changed

 - The `acrossBack` measurement has been removed from all patterns in favor of and `acrossBackFactor` option

### Deprecated

 - Do not use an `acrossBack` measurement in your patterns as it's too hard to measure. Use are fraction of the `shoulderToShoulder` measurement instead (0.96 is a good default).

### Removed

 - The `acrossBack` measurement was removed from `brian` and all patterns that extend it.
  

## 1.7.0

**Release date**: 2018-02-28

While this is mainly a bugfix release, it also exposes the `Part::purgePoints()` method
which used to be private but is now public. The standard theme now also supports centered text.

These changes is the reason for the minor version bump. Apart from that, it's a bugfix release and a 
new option for Sven.

### Added

 - Sven now has ribbing options to choose whether to add ruibbing to the pattern of not
 - The `center` class causes text to be centered in the standard theme

### Changed

 - The `part:purgePoints()` method had been made public to make Wouter happy

### Fixed

#### Sven

 - Fixed a typo in the sven config file

#### Carlita

 - Fixed a misplaced curve control point at the armhole
 - Removed use of opacity as it break PostScript export in Inkscape
 - Fix issue where pocket width as marked on the side panel was not adapt to bust adjustment

#### Carlton/Carlita

 - Added extra markings to help with construction, such as backstay, and fusible interfacing

## 1.6.5

**Release date**: 2018-02-02

This is a bugfix release with updates for Carlton/Carlita.

### Fixes

#### Carlita

 - Fixed a faulty control point location on the armole

#### Carlton/Carlita

 - Removed the opacity attribute from a snippet as it breaks PostScript export in inkscape


## 1.6.4

**Release date**: 2018-02-01

This release adds ribbing to Sven, and fixes the inner pocket tab of Carlton/Carlita

### Added

#### Sven

Sven now takes ribbing options, and drafts the ribbing as needed.
This also avoid confusion when people add ribbing to a Sven that's drafted without ribbing
as that would make the body/sleeves too long.

### Fixed

#### Carlton/Carlita

The shape of the inner pocket tab was incorrect, this has been fixed.


## 1.6.3

**Release date**: 2018-01-31

This release adds inner pockets to Carlton/Carlita

### Added

#### Carlton/Carlita

 - The `innerPocketWelt` part
 - The `innerPocketBag` part
 - The `innerPocketTab` part


## 1.6.2

**Release date**: 2018-01-31

This release includes some tweaks to the shoulder of Carlton/Carlita.

### Changed

#### Carlton/Carlita

 - Lowered the default biceps ease
 - Lowered the default shoulder ease
 - Used only half the shoulder ease across back


## 1.6.1

**Release date**: 2018-01-29

This is a bugfix release:

 - A fix for [issue #203](https://github.com/freesewing/core/issues/203)
 - Some small tweaks in Carlton/Carlita

### Fixed

#### Title formatting

The `Part::addTitle` method has been rewritten to handle title formatting in all use cases
(fixes [issue #203](https://github.com/freesewing/core/issues/203)).

Rather than specifying one layout option (like `vertical-small`) you can now pass an array
with options:

 - `scale` : Default is 100. Increase/decrease for larger/smaller title
 - `rotate` : Default is 0. Given a number to rotate by that many degrees
 - `align` : One of `left`, `right`, or the default `center`

You can combine these options to get pretty much whatever title you like.

In addition, we will properly handle linebreaks in part nr, part title, or message.

#### Carlton/Carlita

 - Only half of the *Chest pocket welt* part was drawn.
 - The hems on the front, tail, and pockets have been straightened
 - Cutting instructions have been updated to include lining

#### Huey

 - There were two parts numbered `4`, that is fixed now.


## 1.6.0

**Release date**: 2018-01-26

This release adds the Carlita Coat pattern. The womenswear version of our Carlton Coat.

### Removed

 - We no longer use Rollbar. Its dependency has been removed in favor of Bail.

## 1.4.0

**Release date**: 2018-01-07

This release adds Rollbar integration to freesewing core, but keeps it is disabled by default.
We've also replaced the abandoned `raveren/kint` with its successor `kint-php/kint` and moved
this package to `require-dev` section as it's only used by the `Developer` theme.

Apart from that, this release fixes a few minor issues, and changes the default armhole depth of Carlton.

> ##### A note about installing on PHP 5.6
>
> Core uses a Developer theme that now requires PHP 7.0 or newer. However, that theme is only 
> useful for hacking core. So if you just want to run this and maybe design some patterns
> install without the dev requirements. 
>
> In other words, to install on PHP 5.6, pass `--no-dev` to composer

### Added

We are now using [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com/) to monitor errors in our application.

Note that Rollbar integration is disabled by default. To enable it, set `rollbar: true` in `config.yml` 

### Changed

#### Carlton

 - The standard value for the `armholeDepth` option in Carlton was changed from 67 to 71, making the 
   armhole slightly deeper by default.

### Fixed

 - Fixed SVG attributes in the `Sampler` theme
 - Fixes a wrong use of `Part::shift` instead of `Part::shiftTowards` in Bent
 - Fixes a `undefined index: lengthBonus` notice being raised in the DesignTutorial pattern 
 - Fixed the user of `isset()` on a function call in the `DraftService` class

## 1.3.0

**Release date**: 2018-01-04

This release addresses 
[issue #204 : Inkscape changes in default units means patterns aren't scaled correctly](https://github.com/freesewing/core/issues/204) 

The fix involves changes in the SVG namespace, units and scaling. 
There's also additional methods to retrieve the core version, as we store that in the SVG now.

In addition to these changes, there is a fix for the Hugo pattern.

### Added

 - The `Pattern::setVersion()` and `pattern::getVersion()` methods
 - The `freesewing` namespace in the SVG output, including the `freesewing:version` and `freesewing:origin` attributes
 - The `BasicJson` and `PaperlessJson` themes in core are version of the `Basic` and `Paperless` theme that return info in JSON format

### Changed

#### SVG Units

The release of Inkscape 0.92 changes their internal handling of userspace units from 90DPI to 96DPI.
The change was made to align themselves with the CSS standard.

This means that when opening one of our patterns in Inkscape version 0.92 or newer, the pattern
will be incorrectly scaled.  
In addition, we use inkscape internally (in freesewing data) to get from SVG patterns to PDF files.
So our own patterns would be at risk of being incorrectly scaled.

To remediate this matter, we can't simply switch to assume 96DPI as that would mean patterns
would scale incorrectly on older Inkscape versions.

Instead, we are now setting a fixed size in mm for the SVG, and map the viewBox so that 1 user unit
equals 1 mm. We really should have done this from the start.

This also removes the need to scale the entire pattern.

#### Custom SVG namespace

We wanted a way to know what specific core version drafted a given SVG.

For this, we've added a custom `freesewing` namespace to the SVG, and we set two attributes:

 - `freesewing::version` : the version of core that generated this SVG. Note that this value is read from the core config file.
 - `freesewing::origin`: the host on which core is running, as supplied by `Request->getInfo()`.

### Removed

 - The `SCALE` static in `SvgRenderbot` as we no longer scale the pattern.

### Fixed

#### Hugo

 - Fixed the `ribbingStretchFactor` option that wasn't properly configured and calculated


## 1.2.9

**Release date**: 2017-12-20

### Added

#### Carlton

The Carlton Coat pattern has been added. The iconic coat worn by benedict cumberbatch in the Sherlock Holmes series.

#### Bent

 - The Bent Body Block pattern has been added. A two-part sleeve variation of the Brian Body block.

### Changed

 - The model name and draft reference is now added to the part titles

### Fixed

 - The `OptionsSampler` new clones a model for every sample iteration, avoiding cumulative side effects if the pattern changes a model


## 1.2.8

**Release date**: 2017-12-14

This is a bugfix release with two small fixes

### Fixed

 - Fix for [Issue #197: Timezone warning in core](https://github.com/freesewing/core/issues/197)
 - Fix for [Issue #198:
        Pathstring depends on commands being seperated by spaces, 
        does not support other whitespace characters
    ](https://github.com/freesewing/core/issues/198)

## 1.2.7

**Release date**: 2017-12-10

This release includes the updated freesewing logo and small bugfixes to Benjaming and FLorent.

### Changed

### Fixed

#### Florent

## 1.2.6

**Release date**: 2017-12-06

This release includes the Florent Flat Cap pattern by @QuentinFelix, 
currently in Beta

### Added

 - Florent is a new pattern, a flat cap. Currently in the Beta namespace

## 1.2.5

**Release date**: 2017-12-03

This is a bugfix release that fixes the order of one of the Benjamin options where the 
default option was not the first in the list (which is somewhat counter-intuitive).

Apart from that, the only change is a typo in the Huey config file. 

### Changed

- Changed order in Benjamin `bowStyle` option so that the default option is the first option

### Fixed

- Fixed a typo in the Huey config file

## Version 1.2.4

**Release date**: 2017-11-14

This release includes the Benjamin Bow Tie pattern by @woutervdub. 
It's our first ever community pattern, and still in beta for now.
More details in 
[the announcement blog post](https://freesewing.org/blog/benjamin-bow-tie-beta/).

### Added

 - Benjamin is a new pattern, a bow tie. It's currently (still) in the Beta namespace.
 - The `path.lashed` CSS class is new in the default theme. It draws a line with long dashes (lashes).
 - The `Utils::asPointArray` methods is new, it returns an array of all points used in a path string

**Release date**: 2017-10-24

This release fixes an option in Aaron and the pocket back of Wahid.

It also adds some community things such as code of conduct and other GitHub community files.

### Fixed

#### Aaron

 - The `shoulderStrapPlacement` options caused issues when it was zero. It's boundaries have been set to avoid that.
 - The pocket bag in Wahid had a leftover welt line and notches outside the part.

## Version 1.2.2

**Release date**: 2017-10-23

This release fixes the offset in the DesignTutorial pattern which was incorrect.

Path offset changed direction in core v1.2.0. At that time, all patterns were updated to
reflect these changes, but the DesignTutorial pattern was overlooked.

### Fixed

#### DesignTutorial

 - Switch pathOffset from -3 to 3

## Version 1.2.1

**Release date**: 2017-10-21

This release includes the HueyHoodie pattern. It's stil in the beta namespace for now.
[This blog post](https://freesewing.org/blog/huey-hoodie-beta/) has more info on what 
it means for a pattern to be in beta.

### Added

 - Huey is a new pattern, a zip-up hoodie for men. It's currently in the Beta namespace

### Changed

The config files had a few minor tweaks related to the frontend integration.

 - Descriptions have been updated
 - inMemoryOf is moved to the info section

### Fixed

 - Changed the button layout so that the top button is closer to the collar

Thanks to @Woutervdub for contributing code for this.  
Thanks to @Stefan1960 for reporting these issues in Simon.

## Version 1.2.0

**Release date**: 2017-10-05

This release fixes an issue with the `Part::angle()` method, and deals with the ripple effects of that change.

It also includes some small improvements to various patterns.

### Changed

#### Part::angle()
The `Part::angle()` method returned results that were 180 degrees off. That's fixed now

> This is kind of a big deal, because angle() is used in a lot of places,
> so there are a bunch of updates to fix them all.
> While this bug should have never been there, I suspect it was introduced
> when trying to work out what quadrant of a circle an angle sits in.
>
> While doing that, it's likely that I got confused thinking that a positive
> delta on the Y-axis puts the angle in the top quadrant (as common sense
> would dictate) but that I lost track for a moment of the fact that in SVG
> the coordinate system works differently, and the Y-axis increments downwards.

All patterns that ship with freesewing core have been updated to handle these changes.
If you have your own patterns, they will need updating too. You should look out for:

 - Any place you use the `Part::angle()` method
 - All path offset methods. The offset is shifted 180 degrees, so multiply your offset by -1

The changes in `Part::angle()` also triggered some changes in other `Part` methods that depend on it.

This is also the change that caused the bump in the minor version.

#### Part::shiftTowards

This method was rewritten to be more concise.

#### Pattern::requested
The new `Pattern::requested()` method contains the full class name of the pattern that was 
requested by the user. 

This is handy for comparison to PHP's magic `__CLASS__` variable to figure out whether your
pattern is the pattern requested by the user, or merely a stepping stone to get there (because
the requested pattern is a (grand)child).

### Fixed

#### Aaron

 - Removed a division by zero check after updating the config file to no longer allow zero.

#### Brian

 - Only true seams if Brian is the requested pattern

#### Simon

 - Prevent a missing `sa` parameter from throwing a warning.

#### Sven

 - Fix issue where the hip measurements wasn't used, but only the chest measurement

#### Theo

 - Prevent a missing `sa` parameter from throwing a warning.
 - Used small titles for smaller pattern parts

#### Theodore

 - Prevent a missing `sa` parameter from throwing a warning.
 - Used small titles for smaller pattern parts

#### Part::addTitle

 - Fixed rendering issue in vertical titles



Prevent a missing `sa` parameter from throwing a warning.

## Version 1.1.3

**Release date**: 2017-09-29

This is a bugfix release.

### Fixed

#### Simon

 - The hip measurement and ease were not taken into account, hip was identical to chest circumference and ease

## Version 1.1.2

**Release date**: 2017-09-17

This is, apart from some tweaks to Simon's defaults, a bugfix release.

### Changed

#### Simon

 - Changed the defaults for some options to make them more sensible

### Fixed

 - The `shoulderSlope` option was incorrectly set to `measure`, rather than `angle`
 - Fixed issue with cuff drape and nr of pleats

#### Theo & Theodore

 - Both patterns now take the `lengthBonus` option into account

## Version 1.0.1

**Release date**: 2017-04-11

This release fixes is crippling typo in package.json and removes 
a tutorial pattern from the core repository.

### Breaking changes

#### Removed the BabyBib pattern

The BabyBib pattern is the subject of our pattern design tutorial in
our documention where we are re-creating it step by step.

Having it in core defeats the point of the tutorial because right 
from the start the entire pattern is there.
So, we've pulled it from core, and are keeping it in its own
[BabyBib repository](https://github.com/freesewing/BabyBib)
for reference.

This is only a breaking change if you were depending on or
extending the BabyBib pattern. Which is unlikely at this
point.

> **Tip:** If you need the BabyBib pattern, you can include it as a Git
submodule.

### Changed

#### Added Packagist info to package.json

The `package.json` file was missing some info that is used 
by Packagist (the PHP package manager). This has been added.

### Fixed

- Fixes an unclosed bracket in composer.json (that was embarassing and 
reason for a new release)

## Version 1.0.0

**Release date**: 2017-03-24

This is the first public release of freesewing.
This changelog is relative to this baseline.
